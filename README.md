## Tech stack
 1. ### Framework 
    I used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) on top of [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).
 2. ### Other plugins
    1. [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
    2. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting

## Page load time
I did 5 experiments to measure the page load time. The result is shown below. Data was measured using [Page load time](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-load-time/fploionmjgeclbkemipmkogoaohcdbig/related?hl=en) chrome extension.

Note: to ensure transparent and fair results and avoid extension disruption, I used chrome incognito .
